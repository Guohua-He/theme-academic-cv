    summary: |
      This project examines how flexible working arrangements, like telecommuting and flextime, impact parental childcare and child well-being across EU countries. Using Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) data, I apply econometric models to assess how labor policies influence the distribution of shared childcare responsibilities, informing policy on work-life balance.
